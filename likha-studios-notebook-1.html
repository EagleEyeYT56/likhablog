Our team is actively exploring multiple tools to ensure our future clients will have the best service possible. While reading <strong>Rich Dad, Poor Dad</strong>, we found we need to create a viable, unique, and efficient system that differentiates us from our competition. Unlike major Do-It-Yourself drag and drop builders like Wix, GoDaddy, Shopify, we are focused on doing the work for our clients. But we need to create a unique system for our business that brings the best quality at the quickest time.</p><p>We are diving into possibly integrating AI. Unlike other services, they only have AI-powered <em>templates</em>, while we are eyeing on possibly using AI to make our website building faster. We utilize AI's such as the popular ChatGPT, but imagine if you can simply type a prompt like:</p><p><em>"I want a website about my restaurant. My themes are Red, Green and Blue. It's named Bob's Chicken. There will also be a menu for the website. Make it simple and visually appealing."</em></p><p>The AI will now begin to generate lines of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It'll then be sent to our team for review and see what changes or <em>hopefully not</em>, errors it might've made. The possibilities are endless!</p><p>But for now we are currently researching on what efficient and powerful website builders we can use for our clients. We are also looking for marketing techniques that we can use for social media, minimizing costs and promoting affordability. </p><p> </p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on April 7, 2023</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://blog.getlikha.com/tags/likha-studios-notebook/">Likha Studios Notebook</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://blog.getlikha.com/authors/gab/" rel="author">Gab</a></h3><p>&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m a youthful and enthusiastic tech enthusiast who keeps up with the latest technological breakthroughs.
