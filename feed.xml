                <p>Search Engine Optimization or SEO, is a very important aspect when it comes to website. SEO's allows sites to gain more visibility and convert viewers to potential customers. It's a great way to be known in today's digital world.</p>
<p>While helping optimize Likha Studios' websites, both their main page and blog page, I've noticed something intriguing. Likha Studios' Blog has more visibility than their main site.</p>
<p>I sat their and wondered why that is, and started digging through. What I found is a great insight you can use too.</p>
<h4>1. Content is King üëë</h4>
<p>Our Blog is primarily focused on providing a wide range of content, from AI, Tech News and Website and Social Media related insights. Because content is fresh and valuable and created regularly, their Blog climbs the Search Engine Ladder higher.</p>
<h4>2. Backlinks are used¬†<em>a lot üîó</em></h4>
<p>When posting about our Blog on Social Media, we include the link to the article we're posting about. When we do, it creates a backlink to our site. Backlinks are simply links from one website to another. One of the ways popular Search Engines such as Google, Bing and Yahoo find or "index" sites is by checking if they are backlinked. Backlinks show credibility and popularity, which is why common Search Engines utilize it.</p>
<h4>3. Keywords are really important ‚å®Ô∏è</h4>
<p>Keywords are heavily used in blog sites and blog writers today. Keywords are a great way to attract potential readers. When looking for a certain topic, readers use keywords related to their topic, and through SEO keyword researching, our Blog is optimized to include that.</p>
<h4>4. Maintained more üõ†Ô∏è</h4>
<p>To be ahead of popular keywords and SEO industry standards, we maintain the Likha Studio Blog more. We regularly change keywords to give our Blog more visibility. In the future, our Blog will have the capabilities to update on it's own with Google's API.</p>
<p>There may be more variables unaccounted for that may affect why our Blog as better SEO visibility than our actual main site, but the reasons we've covered are the primary reasons why. In the next page of Likha's Notebook, we've experimented on this Blog how adding a Meta Description affected the visibility and views of our Blog. Stay tuned for more!</p>

                <p>SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization, which is the process of improving the quality and quantity of traffic to your website from search engines. SEO helps your website rank higher on search engine results pages (SERPs), especially on Google, which is the most popular and widely used search engine in the world.<br><br>Why is SEO important for your website? SEO can help you reach your target audience, increase your brand awareness, generate more leads and conversions, and ultimately grow your business. SEO can also help you gain a competitive edge over your rivals, as well as build trust and credibility with your potential customers.<br><br>How can you apply SEO to your website? SEO is not a one-time thing, but an ongoing process that requires constant monitoring and updating. However, there are some basic steps that you can follow to start optimizing your website for search engines. Here are some of them:<br><br>1. Conduct keyword research. Keywords are the words and phrases that users type into search engines to find what they are looking for. You need to identify the keywords that are relevant to your website's topic, niche, and audience, and use them strategically throughout your website's content, title tags, meta descriptions, headings, URLs, and images. You can use tools like Google Keyword Planner, Moz Keyword Explorer, or SEMrush to find and analyze keywords for your website.<br><br>2. Optimize your website's structure and navigation. Your website's structure and navigation should be clear, logical, and user-friendly, so that both search engines and users can easily find and access your pages. You should use a hierarchical structure with categories and subcategories, and create a sitemap that lists all your pages and links them together. You should also use internal links to connect related pages within your website, and external links to point to authoritative and relevant sources outside your website.<br><br>3. Improve your website's speed and performance. Your website's speed and performance can affect your SEO ranking, as well as your user experience and satisfaction. You should make sure that your website loads fast and smoothly on all devices and browsers, and that it does not have any broken links, errors, or bugs. You can use tools like Google PageSpeed Insights, GTmetrix, or Pingdom to test and improve your website's speed and performance.<br><br>4. Create high-quality and engaging content. Content is the king of SEO, as it is what attracts and retains users on your website. You should create high-quality and engaging content that provides value to your audience, answers their questions, solves their problems, or entertains them. You should also update your content regularly to keep it fresh and relevant. You can use different types of content formats, such as blog posts, articles, videos, podcasts, infographics, ebooks, or webinars, depending on your goals and audience preferences.<br><br>5. Implement on-page and off-page SEO techniques. On-page SEO refers to the optimization of the elements on your website's pages, such as keywords, content, title tags, meta descriptions, headings, images, etc. Off-page SEO refers to the optimization of the elements outside your website's pages, such as backlinks, social media signals, reviews, etc. Both on-page and off-page SEO techniques can help you boost your website's authority and relevance in the eyes of search engines and users.<br><br>These are some of the basic steps that you can follow to apply SEO to your website. However, SEO is a complex and dynamic field that requires constant learning and adaptation. You should always keep up with the latest trends and best practices in SEO, as well as monitor your website's performance and results using tools like Google Analytics or Google Search Console.</p>

                <p>Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of improving the visibility and relevance of a website or a web page in the organic results of a search engine. SEO helps you reach your target audience, drive more traffic to your site, and increase your conversions.<br><br>But why do you need to use SEO? The answer is simple: because there are billions of websites on the internet, and most of them are not indexed by search engines.<br><br>According to Statista, there were about 1.9 billion websites worldwide as of January 2023, but only about 10% of them were indexed by search engines. That means that 90% of the websites were invisible to most online users.<br><br>How many sites are indexed per search engine? The numbers vary depending on the source and the methodology, but here are some estimates:</p>
<p>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.gstatic.com/charts/loader.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
		google.charts.load("current", {
			packages: ["corechart"]
		});
		google.charts.setOnLoadCallback(drawChart);

		function drawChart() {
			var data = google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([
				['Sites', 'Number of sites'],
				['Google', 130000000000],
				['Bing', 35000000000],
				['Yahoo', 25000000000],
				['Yandex', 15000000000],
				['Yandex', 5000000000]
			]);

			var options = {
				title: 'My Daily Activities',
				is3D: true,
				sliceVisibilityThreshold: .05
			};

			var chart = new google.visualization.PieChart(document.getElementById('piechart_3d'));
			chart.draw(data, options);
		}
	</script>
</p>
<div id="piechart_3d" style="width: 900px; height: 500px;"></div>
<p><br><br>- Google: about 130 billion pages indexed as of January 2023<br>- Bing: about 35 billion pages indexed as of January 2023<br>- Yahoo: about 25 billion pages indexed as of January 2023<br>- Yandex: about 15 billion pages indexed as of January 2023<br>- Other Search Engines: about 5 billion pages index as of January 2021<br><br>As you can see, Google has the largest index of web pages, followed by Bing, Yahoo, and Yandex. However, even Google does not index every page on the internet. Some pages are excluded because they are duplicate, low-quality, spammy, or blocked by robots.txt or meta tags.<br><br>Therefore, if you want your website or web page to be found by online users, you need to use SEO techniques to make sure that your site is crawlable, indexable, and relevant for your keywords and topics. SEO helps you stand out from the crowd and get more exposure for your brand and content.</p>

                <p>Did you know that one in four small businesses in New Brunswick still don't have a website or social media presence? This means they are missing out on a huge opportunity to reach potential customers, increase their sales, and grow their brand awareness. In this blog post, we will show you some statistics and benefits of having a website and social media for your business, and how you can get started with Likha Studios.</p>

<p><br>According to a survey by Digital.com, 23% of small businesses with bricks and mortar stores said they don't have a website. The most common reasons for not having a website were that they never needed one, that their customers don't go online, or that they rely on social media for their online needs. However, these excuses are not valid in the 21st century, where e-commerce has been increasing year-over-year for decades. Online shopping is more convenient than in-store shopping, and people are accustomed to researching businesses and services on the internet. Without a website, you are losing out on a large segment of the market that may never find you or trust you.<br><br>Similarly, social media is not enough to build a sustainable brand online. While social media can help you connect with your existing customers and reach new ones, it is not a substitute for having your own website. Social media platforms are constantly changing their algorithms, policies, and features, which means you have little control over how your content is displayed and who sees it. Moreover, social media does not work as a powerful tool for generating traffic to your website. In fact, according to Content Powered, only 6% of the traffic that businesses receive comes from social media. On the other hand, Google searches account for about 49% of the traffic. This means that having a website with quality content that ranks well on search engines is the best way to get more exposure and leads for your business.<br><br>So, what are the benefits of having a website and social media for your business? Here are some of them:<br><br>- You can showcase your products or services in a professional and attractive way, with photos, videos, testimonials, and more.<br>- You can provide useful information to your customers, such as your location, hours, contact details, FAQs, etc.<br>- You can build trust and credibility with your customers by displaying your credentials, awards, reviews, etc.<br>- You can increase your sales by offering online ordering, booking, payment, etc.<br>- You can collect customer data and feedback through forms, surveys, newsletters, etc.<br>- You can create a loyal fan base by engaging with your customers through blogs, comments, social media posts, etc.<br>- You can expand your reach by attracting new customers from different locations, demographics, interests, etc.<br>- You can stand out from your competitors by having a unique and memorable online identity.<br><br>As you can see, having a website and social media for your business is not optional anymore. It is essential for your success and growth. However, we understand that creating and managing a website and social media can be challenging and time-consuming for busy entrepreneurs. That's why we recommend Likha Studios as the best solution for your online needs.<br><br><br></p>

                <p>Video AI generation is a cutting-edge technology that has revolutionized the field of video creation by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to automatically generate videos from text-based content. This innovative approach allows users to create professional-looking videos in minutes, saving both time and resources. Video AI generation has gained significant popularity in recent years due to its potential to streamline the video production process, making it accessible to a wide range of users, from individuals to businesses and organizations.</p>
<p>The concept of video AI generation has been around for several years, with advancements in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) driving its development. The earliest iterations of video AI generation were limited in their capabilities and often required extensive manual editing to produce satisfactory results.

                <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly evolved over the past few years, transforming various aspects of our lives. From chatbots that provide customer service to AI-powered recommendation systems that personalize our online experiences, these technologies have become increasingly prevalent. One prominent example of AI is ChatGPT, a large language model developed by OpenAI that can generate human-like text responses. While AI like ChatGPT has the potential to revolutionize industries and improve our lives, it also poses risks and ethical concerns. In this blog, we'll explore the double-edged sword of AI, delving into the potential dangers of AI like ChatGPT and why it's essential to approach these technologies with caution.</p>
<p>The Power of AI: Its Benefits and Potential</p>
<p>There's no denying the incredible potential of AI. These technologies have the capacity to process vast amounts of data, make predictions, and automate tasks with precision and efficiency. AI-powered systems have been employed in various fields, such as healthcare, finance, transportation, and communication, with promising results. For instance, in healthcare, AI has been used for early disease detection, drug discovery, and personalized treatment plans. In the financial sector, AI has improved fraud detection, risk assessment, and investment strategies. AI has also transformed the way we communicate and interact with technology, with virtual assistants like ChatGPT providing convenient and personalized responses to user queries.</p>
<p>The Dark Side of AI: Its Dangers and Ethical Concerns</p>
<p>While the potential benefits of AI are undeniable, there are significant dangers and ethical concerns associated with AI technologies like ChatGPT. Some of the key concerns include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Bias and Discrimination: Several studies have revealed that AI models, including language models like ChatGPT, can exhibit biases that reflect the biases present in the data used for training. For example, a study conducted by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, found that AI language models tend to amplify gender and racial biases in the text they generate (Bolukbasi et al., 2016). Another study by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) found that popular language models, including ChatGPT, can exhibit biases in their responses to different racial and gender groups (Bender et al., 2021). These biases can result in discriminatory outcomes, such as generating biased content or making biased decisions, leading to unfair treatment of certain groups of people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lack of Accountability and Transparency: The lack of accountability and transparency in AI-generated text is a significant concern. It can be challenging to determine if the content is generated by AI or a human, leading to potential misinformation and manipulation. For instance, a study by OpenAI found that human evaluators were unable to reliably distinguish between text generated by ChatGPT and text written by humans (OpenAI, 2020). This lack of transparency can raise concerns about the authenticity of information, particularly in the context of spreading misinformation, deepfakes, and online fraud.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ethical Use and Misuse: The ethical use of AI is a critical concern, as AI technologies like ChatGPT can be misused for malicious activities. For example, there have been instances of using AI-generated text to spread misinformation, engage in cyberbullying, or conduct online scams. A report by the Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET) highlighted the potential for AI-generated deepfakes to be used for deception, manipulation, and fraud (Brundage et al., 2020). Such unethical use of AI can have serious consequences, leading to harm and damage to individuals, organizations, and society as a whole.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Human Relevance and Job Displacement: The increasing capabilities of AI have raised concerns about its impact on human relevance in the workforce. As AI technologies like ChatGPT automate tasks that were traditionally performed by humans, there are concerns about job displacement and socioeconomic implications. According to a report by the World Economic Forum, it is estimated that by 2025, automation enabled by AI could displace around 85 million jobs in certain industries, while also creating around 97 million new jobs (World Economic Forum, 2020). This significant shift in the job market can have far-reaching consequences for workers, their families, and communities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security and Privacy: The security and privacy of AI-generated text are also critical concerns. As AI models like ChatGPT require vast amounts of data for training, there are concerns about data privacy and security. Unauthorized access to AI models or the data used for training can result in breaches of privacy and security, leading to potential misuse or abuse of the technology. For example, a study by researchers at Stanford University demonstrated that AI models could be manipulated through malicious inputs to produce harmful or biased outputs (Jia and Liang, 2017). This highlights the need for robust security measures and privacy safeguards in the development and use of AI technologies.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In conclusion, while AI technologies such as ChatGPT have immense potential for positive impact, they also come with inherent risks and dangers. The ability of AI to generate realistic text, combined with the potential for biased, misleading, or malicious content, can pose serious threats to individuals, organizations, and society as a whole.</p>
<p>To stay safe from AI dangers such as scams, misinformation, and other malicious uses, it's important for readers to exercise critical thinking skills and be cautious when consuming information generated by AI systems. Here are some tips:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Verify information from multiple reliable sources: Rely on reputable sources for information and fact-check information generated by AI systems. Cross-verify information from multiple reliable sources to ensure accuracy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be wary of unknown sources: Be cautious when interacting with unknown or unverified AI-generated content, especially in emails, messages, or social media posts. Avoid sharing personal information or engaging in financial transactions without thorough verification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stay informed about AI advancements: Stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in AI and their potential implications. Stay informed about ethical guidelines, regulations, and policies related to AI to understand the risks and benefits associated with AI technologies.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By being vigilant and informed, readers can protect themselves from potential AI dangers and minimize the risks associated with the use of AI-generated content.</p>
<p>In a rapidly evolving technological landscape, it's important for individuals and organizations to be proactive in understanding the potential dangers of AI and taking necessary precautions to mitigate risks. Responsible use of AI, coupled with critical thinking and skepticism, can help ensure that we harness the benefits of AI while safeguarding ourselves from its potential dangers.</p>
