From the background of your website to contrasting colours to help viewers see your text more, every detail has to be tended to.</p><p>While Likha Studios was revamping their website for their launch, we've gone over something very important. A period. You heard me right, a period.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.getlikha.com/media/posts/16/Likha-Studios-Homepage-2.png" alt="A picture of the first block on our homepage." width="958" height="553" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://blog.getlikha.com/media/posts/16/responsive/Likha-Studios-Homepage-2-xs.webp 300w, https://blog.getlikha.com/media/posts/16/responsive/Likha-Studios-Homepage-2-sm.webp 480w, https://blog.getlikha.com/media/posts/16/responsive/Likha-Studios-Homepage-2-md.webp 768w"><figcaption>A picture of the first block on our homepage.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Likha, Your Digital Buddy</em> took a lot of brainstorming to craft the perfect hook that'll drive audiences to potential clients. We've put a lot of thought into the process, just like with every one of our clients' work.</p><p>We've gone through multiple variations and versions to what feels best. Looking over countless studies on what the most popular websites do for their first block, we've put in the effort to make sure our site is the best. Instead of a period after <em>Likha</em>, a comma would be the best fit for our first header. It may seem like a small detail, but believe me, it makes a world of difference. You see, a comma creates a sense of continuity, keeping the reader engaged and eager to explore further. It's like a gentle pause, inviting them to take a breath before diving deeper into the captivating content that lies ahead. With our eyes fixed on the data, we've noticed that websites utilizing a comma in their headers tend to experience higher click-through rates and longer user engagement. So, why settle for a period when we can embrace the power of a comma to make our first impression truly unforgettable?</p><p>Another variation was <em>Likha, Your Digital Partner</em>. While partner gave a sense of professionalism, our focus is to help <strong>everyone</strong> create and develop their brand online. Partner felt too professional and would only appeal to business.</p><p>In the grand scheme of website design, it's the little things that make all the difference. From the background colors to the smallest punctuation mark, every detail deserves our attention. Likha Studios understands this philosophy wholeheartedly, and that's why we didn't overlook the significance of a seemingly innocuous period.<br><br>During our website revamp, we invested a considerable amount of time and energy into crafting the perfect hook that would captivate audiences and attract potential clients. We explored various iterations, pouring over countless studies on the practices of successful websites. Our goal was to ensure that our site stood out as the best in its class.<br><br>Surprisingly, it was the choice between a period and a comma that made a world of difference. Instead of a period after "Likha," we decided that a comma would be the optimal fit for our first header. You might think it's a minor detail, but trust us when we say it carries significant weight. A comma creates a sense of continuity, effortlessly keeping readers engaged and enticing them to delve deeper into the captivating content that awaits. It's like a gentle pause, inviting visitors to catch their breath before immersing themselves further. And guess what? The data doesn't lie. Websites that utilize a comma in their headers tend to experience higher click-through rates and longer user engagement.<br><br>So, why settle for a period when we can embrace the power of a comma to make our first impression truly unforgettable? At Likha Studios, we understand the significance of every element, no matter how small. We're committed to helping everyone create and develop their brand online, and even the tiniest tweaks can make a world of difference.</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on May 16, 2023</p><div class="post__share"><h3>Share post:</h3><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.getlikha.com%2Fhow-a-period-made-our-site-better%2F" class="js-share icon brands fa-facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="label">Facebook</span></a></div><div class="post__tag"><ul><li><strong>Tagged in:</strong></li><li><a href="https://blog.getlikha.com/tags/likha-studios-notebook/">Likha Studios Notebook</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.getlikha.com/tags/website-tips-tricks-and-news/">Website Tips, Tricks, and News</a></li></ul></div><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://blog.getlikha.com/authors/gab/" class="invert" rel="author">Gab</a></h3><p>I'm a youthful and enthusiastic tech enthusiast who keeps up with the latest technological breakthroughs.
