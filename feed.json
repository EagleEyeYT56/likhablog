Create a backup schedule and store your website backups in a secure offsite location.</li>\n<li><!--block--><strong>Use Security Plugins:</strong> Security plugins can help you detect and prevent malicious activities on your website. Install reputable security plugins like Sucuri, Wordfence, or iThemes Security to protect your website from hacking attempts.</li>\n<li><!--block--><strong>Monitor Your Website for Suspicious Activities:</strong> Keep an eye on your website's traffic and user activity to detect any suspicious activity.
