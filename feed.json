While DIY website builders are great, they can't provide full control over the website building process, you can't edit the code behind your site.</p>\n<p>While developing our site, we found six letters that changed the way we could handle mobile responsiveness. A problem while making websites mobile responsiveness is how the site handles text.</p>\n<p>The way text is viewed depends on the width and height of the screen.

With six letters, &amp;nbsp;, or Non-breaking Space.</p>\n<p>Non-breaking space is a commonly used HTML entity. An HTML entity is a special code or symbol that represents a specific character or function in HTML. A Non-breaking Space makes sure that the text found in the website will not be separated and put into separate lines. It ensures that when you create a website, what you see is what you get.</p>\n<p>What are the disadvantages to Non-breaking space?</p>\n<p>Because technology today is faster, better and more efficient, you can worry less about taking up bandwidth. Some browsers may not support HTML entities, such as the Non-breaking space, but the number of browsers that do support it is good.</p>\n<p>There are also other HTML entities you can look at.

We've put a lot of thought into the process, just like with every one of our clients' work.</p>\n<p>We've gone through multiple variations and versions to what feels best. Looking over countless studies on what the most popular websites do for their first block, we've put in the effort to make sure our site is the best. Instead of a period after <em>Likha</em>, a comma would be the best fit for our first header. It may seem like a small detail, but believe me, it makes a world of difference. You see, a comma creates a sense of continuity, keeping the reader engaged and eager to explore further. It's like a gentle pause, inviting them to take a breath before diving deeper into the captivating content that lies ahead. With our eyes fixed on the data, we've noticed that websites utilizing a comma in their headers tend to experience higher click-through rates and longer user engagement. So, why settle for a period when we can embrace the power of a comma to make our first impression truly unforgettable?</p>\n<p>Another variation was <em>Likha, Your Digital Partner</em>. While partner gave a sense of professionalism, our focus is to help <strong>everyone</strong> create and develop their brand online. Partner felt too professional and would only appeal to business.</p>\n<p>In the grand scheme of website design, it's the little things that make all the difference. From the background colors to the smallest punctuation mark, every detail deserves our attention. Likha Studios understands this philosophy wholeheartedly, and that's why we didn't overlook the significance of a seemingly innocuous period.<br><br>During our website revamp, we invested a considerable amount of time and energy into crafting the perfect hook that would captivate audiences and attract potential clients. We explored various iterations, pouring over countless studies on the practices of successful websites. Our goal was to ensure that our site stood out as the best in its class.<br><br>Surprisingly, it was the choice between a period and a comma that made a world of difference. Instead of a period after \"Likha,\" we decided that a comma would be the optimal fit for our first header. You might think it's a minor detail, but trust us when we say it carries significant weight. A comma creates a sense of continuity, effortlessly keeping readers engaged and enticing them to delve deeper into the captivating content that awaits. It's like a gentle pause, inviting visitors to catch their breath before immersing themselves further. And guess what? The data doesn't lie. Websites that utilize a comma in their headers tend to experience higher click-through rates and longer user engagement.<br><br>So, why settle for a period when we can embrace the power of a comma to make our first impression truly unforgettable? At Likha Studios, we understand the significance of every element, no matter how small. We're committed to helping everyone create and develop their brand online, and even the tiniest tweaks can make a world of difference.</p>",

SEO's allows sites to gain more visibility and convert viewers to potential customers. It's a great way to be known in today's digital world.</p>\n<p>While helping optimize Likha Studios' websites, both their main page and blog page, I've noticed something intriguing. Likha Studios' Blog has more visibility than their main site.</p>\n<p>I sat their and wondered why that is, and started digging through. What I found is a great insight you can use too.</p>\n<h4>1. Content is King 👑</h4>\n<p>Our Blog is primarily focused on providing a wide range of content, from AI, Tech News and Website and Social Media related insights. Because content is fresh and valuable and created regularly, their Blog climbs the Search Engine Ladder higher.</p>\n<h4>2. Backlinks are used <em>a lot 🔗</em></h4>\n<p>When posting about our Blog on Social Media, we include the link to the article we're posting about. When we do, it creates a backlink to our site. Backlinks are simply links from one website to another. One of the ways popular Search Engines such as Google, Bing and Yahoo find or \"index\" sites is by checking if they are backlinked. Backlinks show credibility and popularity, which is why common Search Engines utilize it.</p>\n<h4>3. Keywords are really important ⌨️</h4>\n<p>Keywords are heavily used in blog sites and blog writers today. Keywords are a great way to attract potential readers. When looking for a certain topic, readers use keywords related to their topic, and through SEO keyword researching, our Blog is optimized to include that.</p>\n<h4>4. Maintained more 🛠️</h4>\n<p>To be ahead of popular keywords and SEO industry standards, we maintain the Likha Studio Blog more. We regularly change keywords to give our Blog more visibility. In the future, our Blog will have the capabilities to update on it's own with Google's API.</p>\n<p>There may be more variables unaccounted for that may affect why our Blog as better SEO visibility than our actual main site, but the reasons we've covered are the primary reasons why. In the next page of Likha's Notebook, we've experimented on this Blog how adding a Meta Description affected the visibility and views of our Blog. Stay tuned for more!</p>\n<p> </p>",

            "content_html": "<p>SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization, which is the process of improving the quality and quantity of traffic to your website from search engines. SEO helps your website rank higher on search engine results pages (SERPs), especially on Google, which is the most popular and widely used search engine in the world.<br><br>Why is SEO important for your website? SEO can help you reach your target audience, increase your brand awareness, generate more leads and conversions, and ultimately grow your business. SEO can also help you gain a competitive edge over your rivals, as well as build trust and credibility with your potential customers.<br><br>How can you apply SEO to your website? SEO is not a one-time thing, but an ongoing process that requires constant monitoring and updating. However, there are some basic steps that you can follow to start optimizing your website for search engines. Here are some of them:<br><br>1. Conduct keyword research. Keywords are the words and phrases that users type into search engines to find what they are looking for. You need to identify the keywords that are relevant to your website's topic, niche, and audience, and use them strategically throughout your website's content, title tags, meta descriptions, headings, URLs, and images. You can use tools like Google Keyword Planner, Moz Keyword Explorer, or SEMrush to find and analyze keywords for your website.<br><br>2. Optimize your website's structure and navigation. Your website's structure and navigation should be clear, logical, and user-friendly, so that both search engines and users can easily find and access your pages. You should use a hierarchical structure with categories and subcategories, and create a sitemap that lists all your pages and links them together. You should also use internal links to connect related pages within your website, and external links to point to authoritative and relevant sources outside your website.<br><br>3. Improve your website's speed and performance. Your website's speed and performance can affect your SEO ranking, as well as your user experience and satisfaction. You should make sure that your website loads fast and smoothly on all devices and browsers, and that it does not have any broken links, errors, or bugs. You can use tools like Google PageSpeed Insights, GTmetrix, or Pingdom to test and improve your website's speed and performance.<br><br>4. Create high-quality and engaging content. Content is the king of SEO, as it is what attracts and retains users on your website. You should create high-quality and engaging content that provides value to your audience, answers their questions, solves their problems, or entertains them. You should also update your content regularly to keep it fresh and relevant. You can use different types of content formats, such as blog posts, articles, videos, podcasts, infographics, ebooks, or webinars, depending on your goals and audience preferences.<br><br>5. Implement on-page and off-page SEO techniques. On-page SEO refers to the optimization of the elements on your website's pages, such as keywords, content, title tags, meta descriptions, headings, images, etc. Off-page SEO refers to the optimization of the elements outside your website's pages, such as backlinks, social media signals, reviews, etc. Both on-page and off-page SEO techniques can help you boost your website's authority and relevance in the eyes of search engines and users.<br><br>These are some of the basic steps that you can follow to apply SEO to your website. However, SEO is a complex and dynamic field that requires constant learning and adaptation. You should always keep up with the latest trends and best practices in SEO, as well as monitor your website's performance and results using tools like Google Analytics or Google Search Console.</p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Did you know that one in four small businesses in New Brunswick still don't have a website or social media presence? This means they are missing out on a huge opportunity to reach potential customers, increase their sales, and grow their brand awareness. In this blog post, we will show you some statistics and benefits of having a website and social media for your business, and how you can get started with Likha Studios.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"https://www.gstatic.com/charts/loader.js\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n\t\tgoogle.charts.load(\"current\", {\n\t\t\tpackages: [\"corechart\"]\n\t\t});\n\t\tgoogle.charts.setOnLoadCallback(drawChart);\n\n\t\tfunction drawChart() {\n\t\t\tvar data = google.visualization.arrayToDataTable([\n\t\t\t\t['Businesses', 'Percentage'],\n\t\t\t\t['Strong Digital Presence', 77],\n\t\t\t\t['Good Website and Social Media Presence', 7],\n\t\t\t\t['Social Media Only', 10],\n\t\t\t\t['Website that could be improved', 5],\n\t\t\t\t['Website Only', 1]\n\t\t\t]);\n\n\t\t\tvar options = {\n\t\t\t\ttitle: 'Digital Presence Statistics',\n\t\t\t\tis3D: true,\n\t\t\t};\n\n\t\t\tvar chart = new google.visualization.PieChart(document.getElementById('piechart_3d'));\n\t\t\tchart.draw(data, options);\n\t\t}\n\t</script>\n</p>\n<div id=\"piechart_3d\" style=\"width: 900px; height: 500px;\"></div>\n<p><br>According to a survey by Digital.com, 23% of small businesses with bricks and mortar stores said they don't have a website. The most common reasons for not having a website were that they never needed one, that their customers don't go online, or that they rely on social media for their online needs. However, these excuses are not valid in the 21st century, where e-commerce has been increasing year-over-year for decades. Online shopping is more convenient than in-store shopping, and people are accustomed to researching businesses and services on the internet. Without a website, you are losing out on a large segment of the market that may never find you or trust you.<br><br>Similarly, social media is not enough to build a sustainable brand online. While social media can help you connect with your existing customers and reach new ones, it is not a substitute for having your own website. Social media platforms are constantly changing their algorithms, policies, and features, which means you have little control over how your content is displayed and who sees it. Moreover, social media does not work as a powerful tool for generating traffic to your website. In fact, according to Content Powered, only 6% of the traffic that businesses receive comes from social media. On the other hand, Google searches account for about 49% of the traffic. This means that having a website with quality content that ranks well on search engines is the best way to get more exposure and leads for your business.<br><br>So, what are the benefits of having a website and social media for your business? Here are some of them:<br><br>- You can showcase your products or services in a professional and attractive way, with photos, videos, testimonials, and more.<br>- You can provide useful information to your customers, such as your location, hours, contact details, FAQs, etc.<br>- You can build trust and credibility with your customers by displaying your credentials, awards, reviews, etc.<br>- You can increase your sales by offering online ordering, booking, payment, etc.<br>- You can collect customer data and feedback through forms, surveys, newsletters, etc.<br>- You can create a loyal fan base by engaging with your customers through blogs, comments, social media posts, etc.<br>- You can expand your reach by attracting new customers from different locations, demographics, interests, etc.<br>- You can stand out from your competitors by having a unique and memorable online identity.<br><br>As you can see, having a website and social media for your business is not optional anymore. It is essential for your success and growth. However, we understand that creating and managing a website and social media can be challenging and time-consuming for busy entrepreneurs. That's why we recommend Likha Studios as the best solution for your online needs.<br><br><br></p>",

            "content_html": "<p>Video AI generation is a cutting-edge technology that has revolutionized the field of video creation by leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to automatically generate videos from text-based content. This innovative approach allows users to create professional-looking videos in minutes, saving both time and resources. Video AI generation has gained significant popularity in recent years due to its potential to streamline the video production process, making it accessible to a wide range of users, from individuals to businesses and organizations.</p>\n<p>The concept of video AI generation has been around for several years, with advancements in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) driving its development. The earliest iterations of video AI generation were limited in their capabilities and often required extensive manual editing to produce satisfactory results. However, with the rapid progress of AI technology, video AI generation has evolved to become more sophisticated and efficient, offering a wide range of features and customization options. Today, video AI generation has become a viable and cost-effective solution for creating high-quality videos, and its continued advancements hold great potential for the future of video production.</p>\n<p>Here are the top 5 best and <strong>currently free</strong> AI Video Generators:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Synthesia.io: Synthesia is a leading AI video creation platform that allows users to create videos from plain text in minutes, supporting 120 languages and saving up to 80% of time and budget. It offers a free AI video creation option with no credit card required, making it accessible for users on a budget.</li>\n<li>Lumen5: Lumen5 is another popular AI video generator that enables users to create videos from text-based content quickly and easily. It offers a free plan with limited features, making it a cost-effective option for users who are just starting out.</li>\n<li>Pictory.ai: Pictory.ai is an AI video generator that allows users to create and edit high-quality videos without any prior experience in video editing or design. It is mentioned as one of the best AI video generators on the market. While it does offer a free trial, the full range of features may require a paid subscription, making it a good option for users who are willing to invest in a more comprehensive video creation tool.</li>\n<li>RunwayML: RunwayML is an AI video generator that offers a range of creative tools, including video generation using AI algorithms. It provides a free plan with limited features, making it accessible for users on a budget. However, additional features may require a paid subscription, which can impact the overall quality and functionality of the generated videos.</li>\n<li>Designs.ai: Designs.ai is an AI-powered creative platform that offers video generation capabilities. It offers a free plan with basic features, making it a budget-friendly option for users who are looking to create videos using AI technology. However, more advanced features may require a paid subscription, which can affect the overall quality and customization options of the generated videos.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Despite its numerous advantages, video AI generation also presents certain disadvantages, ethical concerns, and current limitations. One of the main disadvantages is that video AI generation may lack the human touch and creativity that comes with human-made videos. While AI algorithms can generate videos quickly and efficiently, they may struggle to capture the subtleties of human emotions, nuances, and artistic expressions. Additionally, the quality of generated videos may vary depending on the complexity of the content, and the level of customization options may be limited in some platforms.</p>\n<p>Ethical concerns also surround video AI generation, particularly in the context of misinformation, deepfakes, and copyright infringement. The ability of AI algorithms to generate realistic videos from text raises concerns about the potential for spreading fake news, misinformation, and manipulated content. Deepfakes, in particular, can pose serious ethical challenges as they can be used to create videos that manipulate and deceive viewers. Moreover, there are concerns about the legality and ethical implications of using copyrighted content in generated videos, as AI algorithms may inadvertently incorporate copyrighted material without proper permissions.</p>\n<p>Despite the advancements in video AI generation, there are also current limitations to consider. Some limitations include the accuracy and quality of generated videos, which may still fall short of human-made videos in terms of creativity and authenticity. The complexity and cost of AI technology may also be a barrier for some users, as more advanced features and customization options may require a higher subscription or usage fees. Additionally, the potential biases in AI algorithms used in video AI generation, such as gender or racial biases, raise concerns about fairness, diversity, and inclusivity in the content produced by these technologies.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, while video AI generation offers many benefits, it also has disadvantages, ethical concerns, and current limitations to be mindful of. As with any emerging technology, it is important to weigh the pros and cons, consider ethical implications, and be aware of the current limitations when using video AI generation tools. Proper usage, ethical considerations, and awareness of limitations can help ensure responsible and effective use of video AI generation in various contexts.</p>\n<p> </p>",
